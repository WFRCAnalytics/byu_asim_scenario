1. Run tar_make() -- it should run up until skims_file. This is where it will break.

2. After it breaks, manually download these two files (copy and paste them into your browser) and replace them with the ones located in inputs/skims
	* skm_auto_Ok.mtx.omx: https://byu.box.com/shared/static/s4tkpcdtz367dbgiyu1q9jy5kxp44fcm.omx
	* skm_auto_Pk.mtx.omx: https://byu.box.com/shared/static/j2jx524u6exlzcfjiyh6p0wgao1wunr8.omx
	
3. Once the skm_auto skims are replaced, run tar_make() again -- you should pass the skims_file target

4. It will likely break at popsim_success. So, lets create the popsim environment
	* Open Windows Powershell
	* Run the following commands:
		- conda create -y -n popsim
		- conda activate popsim
		- conda install -y pytables
		- pip install scipy
		- pip install populationsim
		
5. If popsim still breaks with the following error (), try running popsim outside of R and targets. Run the following command in the command prompt:=
  * python runpopsim.py --config configs_popsim --data data_popsim --output output_popsim
If popsim runs successfully, update the target popsim_success in the targets pipline to point to the output file: 
  * tar_target(popsim_sucess, "output_popsim/synthetic_persons.csv", format = "file")
